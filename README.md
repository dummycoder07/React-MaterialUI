# React-MaterialUI

# Material UI
- It is a UI Component library.
- It provides us with components to build awesome user interface in quick time.
- It is also an implementation of Google's material design specification.

# Typography
- The Typography component follows the Material Design typographic scale that provides a limited set of type sizes that work well together for a consistent layout.
- Some variant types:
  1. h1
  2. h2
  3. h3
  4. h4
  5. h5
  6. h6
  7. subtitle1
  8. subtitle2
